      "Outside of asset markets, inflation didn’t make its presence felt much in 2020. Excluding volatile food and energy components, the core consumer price index, or CPI, rose by 1.6% year over year in November, the latest month available. The Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, increased by 1.4%. Core CPI hasn’t been above 2% since March, while core PCE hasn’t touched it since 2018. That’s expected to change in the coming year, at least a little bit. Economists’ consensus estimate is for a 1.8% increase in core CPI in 2021, according to FactSet, and the Federal Reserve’s latest summary of economic projections also has core PCE inflation rising to 1.8% in 2021, on its way to 2% in the longer run. Some pickup in inflation isn’t a fringe viewpoint: An RBC Capital Markets survey of investors in December found that 59% of respondents believed that inflation will accelerate in the coming six to 12 months. An important question, however, is whether that acceleration lifts inflation into a faster-growth Goldilocks zone, or meaningfully above that.  An inflation rate near the Fed’s 2% target would be a positive development, reflecting a healing economy and creating incentives for investment and spending. It also keeps the deflationary “death spiral” scenario at bay. \n",

      "But there are several strong, albeit theoretical, arguments in favor of an even greater pickup in inflation. That’s far from priced into equity or fixed-income valuations, and a faster rate of price increases would be a major shock to markets if it does appear later in 2021. “Unlike most Fed officials, I do not have a high degree of conviction on where inflation is headed in 2021, but I view a pickup to above prepandemic levels as at least as likely as a continuation of softer increases,” writes Stephen Stanley, Amherst Pierpont’s chief economist. Foremost in favor of higher inflation is the unprecedented scale of money-printing by the Fed in 2020. Since March, the supply of U.S. dollars has increased by almost 25%. In other words, about 1 in every 5 dollars that exist today have been created in the past nine months. Monetarist theory, which focuses on the macroeconomic effects of changes in the money supply, is screaming for an increase in prices under such a massive expansion. Combine that with a surge in postpandemic demand that could outstrip supply, government deficits that aren’t going away, and the Fed’s new policy framework that will tolerate an increase in inflation, and it’s possible that upward pressure on prices arrives sooner rather than later. If greater inflation lifts market rates—or spurs the Fed to step in with higher interest rates sooner than expected—the investment implications are significant. “What people don’t fully realize in my view is that we’re entering a very different investment world than what we’ve gotten used to in the past decade,” says Mike Wilson, Morgan Stanley’s chief U.S. equity strategist. The bank’s economists expect the 10-year yield to rise to 1.45% by year end, from 0.913% at the end of 2020, and for the 30-year to hit 2.40%, from 1.642%. The counterargument to the inflation hawks is that the past decade of low inflation has shown us that it’s not purely a monetary phenomenon—and that maybe monetarist theory isn’t worth all that much in today’s world. Disinflationary structural forces remain, including an aging population that prioritizes saving over spending and technological improvements that reduce costs and boost productivity. Plus, pent-up demand spending may prove temporary and limited to specific services like airfare, high unemployment could keep wages down, and commercial rents could remain under pressure, eliminating another source of rising costs. In the stock market, bond-proxy sectors like utilities and real estate stand to lose from a rise in inflation and rates. So do richly valued growth and technology stocks, which would see their multiples drop. Future earnings are worth less today under a higher discount rate.\n",
      "Conversely, bank stocks, most of all, stand to gain from a potential sustained pickup in inflation. Banks’ net interest margins and profits rise the more that long-term rates exceed short-term ones—their bread-and-butter business is borrowing short to lend long. Add an improving economy, the Fed’s green light for greater capital returns to shareholders, and cheaper relative valuations, and banks could be the place to be in 2021. The \n",

      "LONDON — Britain’s long and sometimes acrimonious divorce from the European Union ended Thursday with an economic split that leaves the EU smaller and the U.K. freer but more isolated in a turbulent world. Britain left the European bloc’s vast single market for people, goods and services at 11 p.m. London time, midnight in Brussels, completing the biggest single economic change the country has experienced since World War II. A new U.K.-EU trade deal will bring its own restrictions and red tape, but for British Brexit supporters, it means reclaiming national independence from the EU and its web of rules.\n",
      "\n",
      "Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whose support for Brexit helped push the country out of the EU, said it was “an amazing moment for this country.” “We have our freedom in our hands, and it is up to us to make the most of it,” he said in a New Year’s video message. The break comes 11 months after a political Brexit that left the two sides in the limbo of a “transition period” — like a separated couple still living together, wrangling and wondering whether they can remain friends. Now the U.K. has finally moved out. It was a day some had been longing for and others had been dreading since Britain voted in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU, but it turned out to be something of an anticlimax. U.K. lockdown measures to curb the coronavirus curtailed mass gatherings to celebrate or mourn the moment, though Parliament’s huge Big Ben bell sounded 11 times on the hour as it prepared to ring in the new year at midnight. A free trade agreement sealed on Christmas Eve after months of tense negotiations ensures that Britain and the 27-nation EU can continue to buy and sell goods without tariffs or quotas. That should help protect the 660 billion pounds ($894 billion) in annual trade between the two sides, and the hundreds of thousands of jobs that rely on it. But companies face sheaves of new costs and paperwork, including customs declarations and border checks. Traders are struggling to digest the new rules imposed by a 1,200-page trade deal that was agreed just a week before split. The English Channel port of Dover and the Eurotunnel passenger and freight route braced for delays as the new measures were introduced, though the coronavirus pandemic and a holiday weekend meant cross-Channel traffic was light, with only a trickle of trucks arriving at French border posts in Calais as 2020 ended. The vital supply route was snarled for days after France closed its border to U.K. truckers for 48 hours last week in response to a fast-spreading variant of the virus identified in England. The British government insisted that “the border systems and infrastructure we need are in place, and we are ready for the U.K.’s new start.” But freight companies were holding their breath. Youngs Transportation in the U.K. suspended services to the EU until Jan. 11 “to let things settle.” “We figure it gives the country a week or so to get used to all of these new systems in and out, and we can have a look and hopefully resolve any issues in advance of actually sending our trucks,” said the company’s director, Rob Hollyman. The services sector, which makes up 80% of Britain’s economy, does not even know what the rules will be for business with the EU in 2021 — many of the details have yet to be hammered out. Months and years of further discussion and argument over everything from fair competition to fish quotas lie ahead as Britain and the EU settle into their new relationship as friends, neighbors and rivals. Hundreds of millions of individuals in Britain and the bloc also face changes to their daily lives. Britons and EU citizens have lost the automatic right to live and work in the other’s territory. From now on, they will have to follow immigration rules and obtain work visas. Tourists will not need visas for short trips, but new headaches — from travel insurance to pet paperwork — still loom for Britons visiting the continent. For some in Britain, including the prime minister, it’s a moment of pride and a chance for the U.K. to set new diplomatic and economic priorities. Johnson said the U.K. was now “free to do trade deals around the world, and free to turbocharge our ambition to be a science superpower.” Conservative lawmaker Bill Cash, who has campaigned for Brexit for decades, said it was a “victory for democracy and sovereignty.” That’s not a view widely shared across the Channel. In the French president’s traditional New Year’s address, Emmanuel Macron expressed regret. “The United Kingdom remains our neighbor but also our friend and ally,” he said. “This choice of leaving Europe, this Brexit, was the child of European malaise and lots of lies and false promises.” France’s European affairs minister, Clément Beaune, said the promises made by Brexiteers — “a sort of total freedom, a lack of restrictions, of influence — I think will not happen.” Many in Britain felt apprehension about a leap into the unknown that is taking place during a pandemic that has upended life around the world. “I feel very sad that we’re leaving,” said Jen Pearcy-Edwards, a filmmaker in London. “I think that COVID has overshadowed everything that is going on. But I think the other thing that has happened is that people feel a bigger sense of community, and I think that makes it even sadder that we’re breaking up our community a bit, by leaving our neighbours in Europe. “I’m hopeful that we find other ways to rebuild ties,” she said.\n",

      "About those red flags: The sheer number of initial public offerings has helped fuel the comparisons to the dot-com bubble, as nearly 500 companies went public in 2020, the most since 1999. But that number may overstate things a bit. If only operating companies with share prices of $5 or more are included, then just 163 initial offerings hit the market, according to data from Jay Ritter, a professor at University of Florida Warrington College of Business—about a third of the 476 that went public in 1999 and only the most since 2014. And even with some of the hottest IPOs, it’s possible to make a case that they can grow into their valuations, Ritter says. “In 1999 and 2000, it was a bubble with 100% certainty,” he explains. “With a company like Airbnb, an established market leader, the chance that the company disappears in five years is zero.” SPACs make up the majority of the discrepancy in the IPO numbers in 2020. The blank-check companies accounted for 248 offerings last year, more than four times the previous record. That might be bubbly in and of itself, but if it is, it’s a very 2020 kind of bubble, as investors, unable to lock in reasonable returns in the bond market, bet their cash on empty shells, hoping for the next QuantumScape.  Gambling on the stock market appeared to be a favorite pastime for investors in 2020. Margin debt—the amount of money borrowed against stockholdings to play the market—hit a record $722 billion in November, its first record high in two years. That sounds scary. But margin debt often hits record highs as the stock market rises, making it a notoriously bad timing tool. What’s more, margin debt as a percentage of the overall value of the market is now near a 15-year low, which suggests that investors aren’t overextended just yet. What has changed is the pace at which investors are adding to their debt. It’s up about 50% from its spring low, and that kind of surge has happened only six times since 1960. A quick spike in margin debt hasn’t always been a problem for the market, particularly in the short term, with the \n",
      "        S&P 500 \n",
      "      index gaining a median 1.7% in the six months following such a surge. Problems can show up further out, however: The S&P was down 2.3% one year out, and down 7.4% two years after the surge. “Over the past five years, all the ‘sell now!’ statements from those bearish on the market, using margin debt as an excuse, haven’t had much empirical support,” writes Sundial Capital Research founder Jason Goepfert. “[There] is more of an argument now that it’s starting to become a warning sign. A minor one, still, but a warning nonetheless.”  A better way to spot a bubble: look at whether a stock, asset class, or fund has gone “parabolic,” or seen its trend steepen as it moves higher. Bay Crest Partners’ Jonathan Krinsky looks at how far an asset is trading above its 200-day moving average to see just how extended it is and whether a bubble could be in the offing.

That, of course, is changing. Tesla, up 743% in 2020 alone, recently was added to the S&P 500, but even a massive drop in its price couldn’t take down the index on its own. “There will be pockets of volatility,” says Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. “But it won’t spread and lead us into a bear market.” None of this is to say that the market is in a great place. At 22.5 times forward earnings, the S&P 500 is far from cheap, and the Shiller price/earnings ratio, at 33.9 times, is even higher. Those valuations make sense only relative to zero interest rates in the U.S., as even expensive multiples look attractive when the alternative is earning nothing on cash. Read more Up and Down Wall Street:Don’t Worry About a Weak Dollar. Here’s Why. That is, of course, unless the economic recovery that investors have pinned their hopes on really does cause earnings to return to pre-Covid-19 levels faster than the market is counting on. Even those who see signs of mania in the index’s rally acknowledge that won’t happen anytime soon. “It awaits proof that the faith in this big economic recovery later in 2021 was faulty,” writes David Rosenberg of Rosenberg Research. “That is quite a long time away.” Our bet is that the earnings recovery does materialize, and that markets will hold their own. But we still aren’t expecting much more from the S&P 500. The index gained 16% in 2020 and 29% in 2019, and rarely climbs more than 10% for a third year in a row, according to Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. The S&P 500 has posted three or more years of double-digit gains just five times since 1928, with the most recent occurring from 2012 through 2014. “If we had to guesstimate, we’d say 80% of all the baseline good news expected in 2021 is already incorporated in an S&P 500 at 3700 in late December 2020,” Colas writes.

      "WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Thursday extended pandemic-related bans on issuing green cards and work visas to large groups of applicants outside the United States through March 31. Federal judges limited the impact but the bans, however short-lived, significantly tightened legal immigration, a goal that had eluded Trump before the coronavirus struck. They had been set to expire Thursday.\n",
      "\n",
      "An extension is consistent with Trump’s hardline stance on immigration and passes on the decision over when and whether to lift the bans to President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office Jan. 20. Biden’s immigration platform doesn’t specifically address the issue. In April, Trump imposed a ban on green cards issued abroad that largely targets family members of people already in the United States. After a surprisingly chilly reception from immigration hawks, the administration went much further in June by adding H-1B visas, which are widely used by American and Indian technology company workers and their families; H-2B visas for nonagricultural seasonal workers; J-1 visas for cultural exchanges; and L-1 visas for managers and other key employees of multinational corporations. Trump said the measures would protect American jobs in a pandemic-wracked economy, while business groups said they would hamper a recovery. By contrast, the administration’s edict to immediately expel asylum-seekers and others who cross the border illegally from Mexico was justified on grounds of containing the coronavirus, though reporting by The Associated Press and others found that government scientists saw no evidence for it. A temporary ban on non-essential travel across the Mexican and Canadian borders was also done for public health. In October, U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White of San Francisco, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, ruled that the work-visa ban could not be enforced against groups that sued and their members, who represent much of the U.S. economy: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Retail Federation, technology industry group TechNet and Intrax Inc., which manages cultural exchange programs. In December, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen of Oakland, California, an appointee of President Barack Obama, prevented the green-card ban from taking effect against families of 181 U.S. citizens and legal residents who sued.\n",

      "What’s more, a strong dollar makes it more difficult for the Fed to increase inflation and makes U.S. goods more expensive, harming exporters, notes Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank. A weak buck is good for the rest of the world, too, particularly emerging markets, which borrow in greenbacks. “The contribution of a weak USD to easier financing conditions probably makes it desirable at this stage of the global recovery,” he writes. But, says Rosenberg, the weakness might be exacerbated by the dollar’s being a “global liquidity barometer. All anyone needs to do every day in terms of how to trade risk is to first look at the chart of the DXY dollar index. The weaker the index is, the more power there is to the risk-on trade,” in other words, investing in stocks. Historically, a weak dollar boosts small-cap and economically sensitive stocks—not that one is necessarily needed. Andrew Slimmon, managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, notes that sectors exposed to economic growth—think banks and energy—usually outperform coming out of a recession. At the same time, investors are still overcommitted to what has worked—see above—and underpositioned for a secular shift to cyclicals, which could provide another boost. “I wouldn’t make an assumption about the dollar and invest in certain sectors,” Slimmon says. “There are other things that are more important.” In this case, however, it can’t hurt.

      "What’s more, a strong dollar makes it more difficult for the Fed to increase inflation and makes U.S. goods more expensive, harming exporters, notes Steve Englander, head of global G10 FX research at Standard Chartered Bank. A weak buck is good for the rest of the world, too, particularly emerging markets, which borrow in greenbacks. “The contribution of a weak USD to easier financing conditions probably makes it desirable at this stage of the global recovery,” he writes. But, says Rosenberg, the weakness might be exacerbated by the dollar’s being a “global liquidity barometer. All anyone needs to do every day in terms of how to trade risk is to first look at the chart of the DXY dollar index. The weaker the index is, the more power there is to the risk-on trade,” in other words, investing in stocks. Historically, a weak dollar boosts small-cap and economically sensitive stocks—not that one is necessarily needed. Andrew Slimmon, managing director at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, notes that sectors exposed to economic growth—think banks and energy—usually outperform coming out of a recession. At the same time, investors are still overcommitted to what has worked—see above—and underpositioned for a secular shift to cyclicals, which could provide another boost. “I wouldn’t make an assumption about the dollar and invest in certain sectors,” Slimmon says. “There are other things that are more important.” In this case, however, it can’t hurt.

      "This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other in most of the world, with many bidding farewell to a year they’d prefer to forget. From the South Pacific to New York City, pandemic restrictions on open air gatherings saw people turning to made-for-TV fireworks displays or packing it in early since they could not toast the end of 2020 in the presence of friends or carousing strangers.\n",
      "\n",
      "As midnight rolled from Asia to the Middle East, Europe, Africa and the Americas, the New Year’s experience mirrored national responses to the virus itself. Some countries and cities canceled or scaled back their festivities, while others without active outbreaks carried on like any other year. Australia was among the first to ring in 2021. In past years, 1 million people crowded Sydney’s harbor to watch fireworks. This time, most watched on television as authorities urged residents to stay home to see the seven minutes of pyrotechnics that lit up the Sydney Harbor Bridge and its surroundings.\n",

      "In New York’s Times Square, the ball dropped like always, but police fenced off the site synonymous with New Year’s Eve to prevent crowds of any size from gathering. Another of the world’s most popular places to be on December 31, Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, pressed ahead with its revelry despite a surge of infections. Images of masked health care workers briefly lit up Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower, before fireworks exploded in the sky over the building. Tens of thousands of people flooded the streets and squares marked out for social distancing were largely ignored. Still, the pandemic robbed the night of its freewheeling spirit. Authorities implemented a raft of anti-virus measures to control rowdy crowds in downtown Dubai. At luxury bars and restaurants, music blared and people drank, but dancing was strictly prohibited. The gleam of Las Vegas brought a similar crowd, with tens of thousands of people walking on the Strip by early evening despite a plea from the governor to avoid gatherings. South Africans were also urged to cancel parties. Many instead lit candles as a way to honor health workers and people who have died in the COVID-19 pandemic. In many European countries, authorities warned they were ready to clamp down on revelers breaching public health rules, including nightly curfews in France, Italy, Turkey, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Greece. “No one will be on the streets after 10 p.m. (Athens) will be a dead city to make sure no more restrictions are imposed,” said Greece’s public order minister, Michalis Chrisohoidis. France’s government flooded the streets with 100,000 law enforcement officers to enforce the nationwide curfew. A few families gathered in Madrid’s sunny central Puerta de Sol square to listen to the rehearsal of the traditional ringing of the bells that is held at midnight. They followed the Spanish custom of eating 12 grapes with each stroke of the bells before police cleared the area that normally hosts thousands of revelers. “That’s it, life goes on. Despite what happened we have to celebrate,” said Cesar Pulido, 32, who celebrated in Madrid. “We have to eat the 12 grapes in order to ask 12 wishes like health, love, money, everything and good vibes.” As the clock struck midnight, fireworks erupted over Moscow’s Red Square and the Acropolis in Athens, but the explosions echoed across largely empty streets as people obeyed orders to stay home. From Berlin to Brussels, normally raucous celebrations were muted by the pandemic. Even the British government, keen to celebrate the U.K.’s definitive split from the EU, ran ads imploring the public to “see in the New Year safely at home” amid a record number of newly confirmed cases. London’s annual New Year’s Eve fireworks display was canceled, but an unannounced display was broadcast before midnight, with tributes to health care workers, a reference to the Black Lives Matter movement and even a voice saying “you’re on mute” in reference to a bugbear of virtual work meetings. In Scotland, residents normally mark the new year with parties and “first footing,” where a home’s first visitor of the year comes bearing gifts. The tradition is among the list of activities the government warned against. “No gatherings, no house parties, no first-footing. Instead, we should bring in 2021 in our own homes with just our own households,” Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said. Many around the world looked toward 2021 with hope, partly due to the arrival of vaccines that offer a chance of beating the pandemic. “Although this was a very difficult year, a year of many losses, I’m grateful to be safe, to follow the rules, to do my part,” said Marilia Rafael, 33, who celebrated in Portugal, “and would like to ask that the next year may be better for all of us, may it be a year of hope, peace and love.” More than 1.8 million deaths worldwide have been linked to the coronavirus since the start of the pandemic. Some leaders, such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel, used their New Year’s address to thank citizens for enduring hardship during the lockdown and criticize those who defied the rules. Others, like Italy’s President Sergio Mattarella, flew the flag for science, urging citizens to discard their fears about getting immunized against COVID-19. “Faced with an illness so highly contagious, which causes so many deaths, it’s necessary to protect one’s own health and it’s dutiful to protect those of the others – family members, friends, colleagues,’’’ said Mattarella, 79. In Brazil’s Rio de Janeiro, where official fireworks and celebrations also were canceled to limit the rapid spread of the virus, police officers braced for what promised to be a long night. Rio officials decided to seal off Copacabana, where millions of people dressed in white usually gather on the beach to marvel at fireworks and attend large concerts. This year, between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. on Jan. 1, only local residents will be able to access the city’s iconic shore, authorities said. In South Korea, Seoul’s city government canceled its annual New Year’s Eve bell-ringing ceremony in the Jongno neighborhood for the first time since the event was first held in 1953, months after the end of the Korean War. New Zealand, which is two hours ahead of Sydney, and several of its South Pacific island neighbors that also have no active COVID-19 cases held their usual New Year’s activities. In Chinese societies, the virus ensured more muted celebrations of the solar New Year, which is less widely observed than the Lunar New Year that in 2021 will fall in February. Initial reports about a mystery respiratory illness sickening people in the Chinese city of Wuhan emerged exactly a year ago.\n",

      "Vice President Mike Pence asked a federal judge in Texas on Thursday to dismiss a Republican congressman’s attempt to give him the power to decide which electoral votes to count when Congress meets on Jan. 6, dealing another blow to GOP efforts to install President Trump for a second term. In court filings signed by Trump appointees, the Justice Department called the lawsuit, filed this week by Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas, a “walking legal contradiction” because it takes aim at the vice president, “ironically the very person whose power they seek to promote.”\n",

      "The lawsuit, filed by Gohmert and a number of Republicans in Arizona, challenges the procedures governing Congress’ counting of electoral votes next week, which will cement Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. Those long-established measures, spelled out in the Electoral Count Act of 1887, say the vice president’s role in announcing the election results is purely ceremonial. Gohmert argued the process unconstitutionally binds Pence from exercising “exclusive authority” to determine which elector votes to count at the Jan. 6 joint session of Congress he oversees.
