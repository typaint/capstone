The PMCCâ„¢ will assist retail Pharmacies, Hospitals and Satellite/Temporary/Off-Site Locations with starting and maintaining drive-thru vaccination clinics that follow the CDC's best practices which are essential for patient safety and vaccine effectiveness.Â Â  \n",

      "CDC guidelines state \"do not store any vaccine in a dormitory-style or bar-style refrigerator under any circumstances as they pose a significant risk of freezing vaccines, even when used for temporary storage.\" This requirement by the CDC makes our MicroCool Refrigerator ideal for the strict requirements associated with storing pharmaceuticals such as the new Covid-19 vaccinations. The MicroCoolÂ®Â also integrates with any Digital Data Logger (DDL) an entity may choose to use. The PMCCâ„¢ is fully customized by each entity to meet their vaccine drive thru needs,\" said Scott Norman, CEO of Creche Innovations. Pharmacies or Hospitals can add additional accessories to the PMCC addressing their specific needs, such as adding built-in tablet charging stations, vaccine record card holder, waste container, various storage drawer sizes for the organization and immediate access to the following required Covid-19 supplies: needles of various sizes (dependent on population served), syringes, alcohol prep pads, PPE's for vaccinators, Covid-19 vaccination record cards, vaccine needle and length guide, diluent and mixing supplies (based on vaccine product) and much more. \n",
      "\n",
      "The PMCCâ„¢Â ensures that all Covid-19 vaccination providers, participating in the U.S. Covid-19 Vaccination Program are able to: \n",
      "\n",
      "Maintain cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times, with one or more locking mechanisms, in accordance with the EUA/vaccine packet insert and CDC guidelines \n",
      "Monitor the MicroCoolÂ® Refrigerator temperature at all times using a DDL of their choosing \n",
      "Ensure proper vaccine and supply inventory prior to the start of each vaccination clinic day \n",
      "Have immediate access to all required Covid-19 Ancillary Supplies \n",
      "Per the CDC, every year vaccine storage and handling errors result in revaccination and significant financial losses to the healthcare community due to wasted vaccines. Failure to store and handle vaccines properly causes our population to lose confidence in vaccines and their providers (due to a revaccination) because the vaccines they received may have been compromised. The PMCCâ„¢ allows providers to properly store and handle vaccines with the built-in MicroCoolÂ® Refrigerator.

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif., Dec. 31, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Before 2020, contactless delivery was a term only used in small niches of big box retail to save staff hours. Customers could order something online and pick it up through an app-connected locker system installed at the front of the store rather than at the customer service desk. Today, in the presence of COVID-19, contactless delivery in the United States has become a public health necessity, propelling the industry's pioneer, Sacramento-based Luxer One, to be the first company to reach 100-million deliveries of everything from packages, retail purchases and school books to legal paperwork, student laptops and food delivery by a smart locker.\n",
      "\"The growth in the need for smart lockers since COVID-19 is nothing short of remarkable,\" says Arik Levy, Founder and CEO ofÂ Luxer One.Â \"We've gone from being a smart locker company primarily serving package management for condominium complexes and some retail stores to a contactless solution company serving multiple industries for a variety of purposes in less than one year. I had a long-term vision of this, since smart lockers and automation are quite common in Europe; but the speed with which it happened in the U.S. was stunning.\"\n",
      "In 2019, Luxer was ranked the #1 Multifamily Package Locker System by Kingsley Report; today, their lockers are found in 1000s of Class A Apartment Buildings, hundreds of libraries, offices, government buildings and retail stores, several California State Universities, including UCLA,Â Honeywell, Macy's, Foot Locker, and America's top home improvement retailer.Â Â  \n",
      "\"Ultimately, with the imminent growth of the government sector as well as installations in major retailers, we will reach a paradigm where smart lockers are essentially everywhere and meant for public use versus use by a single business,\" adds Levy. \"Delivery of anything to a home address will become less and less common in favor of a more secure, more connected and more economical public locker model.\"\n",
      "Luxer One first introduced high-quality, smart locker systems for package management more than a decade ago. They also developed the industry's first-ever iOS software for smart lockers. Today, they are considered the go-to smart locker for quality, aesthetics and ease of use. A basic Luxer locker system can be installed anywhere in the United States in just a few days, and a variety of payment options make them as affordable as $249 per month.\n",

      "Economic Recovery and StimulusNathaniel Cline Professor, Economics University of Redlands \"Further recovery absolutely requires further stimulus at this point. The unemployment insurance expansions were wildly successful and should be restored. State and local budgets need federal support to avoid cuts to essential services, but also to avoid being a drag on spending recovery. We should not forget that the slow growth after 2008 was in no small part due to state and local government austerity,\" Cline says. \"The second point is that we are indeed experiencing a two-speed recovery as many people have pointed out, but there are some unique features as compared to previous recoveries. In particular, we are not seeing parents of children return to work, and service sectors like education and health (which are usually resilient) are shedding jobs. So in addition to the usual two-speed recovery (in which workers from minority groups and low-income workers fall behind), we are leaving behind teachers and nurses. Point three, going forward, the speed of the recovery is, as always.\" Dr. Nathaniel Cline can speak to a broad scope of economic topics, including the economic recovery, debate over unemployment compensation, the recession, and the healthcare vs. economy debate.

      "3 Tips to Reduce Volatility and Cultivate CalmAnne Ockene Boudreau AuthorAnne Ockene Boudreau \"1) Don't Assume People Are Your Enemy: Despite the volatility in our current climate, making assumptions about another person's intentions is never a wise position to take. Rather than reacting with anger or irritation, accept another's point of view and agree to disagree. This will cut through unnecessary strain. 2) Find a Common Ground: With all of the raw divisiveness in the air, rather than recycling sensitive topics with others, establish a level playing field for communication that is based on something you both enjoy or love, whether it is a hobby, sports, music, or other area of common interest. This will mitigate strain and foster commonality and mutual respect. 3) Be the Person to Diminish the Acrimony: It is always wise to take the path of least resistance when it comes to areas of strife. Rather than responding to comments with equal or greater insults, be the person to quell challenging conversations and differences of opinion. It is sensible to silence potentially volatile conversations before they become heated by regulating your own emotions and approaching others with a cool head.\" Anne Ockene Boudreau is an inspirational author, coach, and executive who is devoted to helping others develop healthy self-worth.

      "CDC guidelines state \"do not store any vaccine in a dormitory-style or bar-style refrigerator under any circumstances as they pose a significant risk of freezing vaccines, even when used for temporary storage.\" This requirement by the CDC makes our MicroCool Refrigerator ideal for the strict requirements associated with storing pharmaceuticals such as the new Covid-19 vaccinations. The MicroCoolÂ®Â also integrates with any Digital Data Logger (DDL) an entity may choose to use. The PMCCâ„¢ is fully customized by each entity to meet their vaccine drive thru needs,\" said Scott Norman, CEO of Creche Innovations. Pharmacies or Hospitals can add additional accessories to the PMCC addressing their specific needs, such as adding built-in tablet charging stations, vaccine record card holder, waste container, various storage drawer sizes for the organization and immediate access to the following required Covid-19 supplies: needles of various sizes (dependent on population served), syringes, alcohol prep pads, PPE's for vaccinators, Covid-19 vaccination record cards, vaccine needle and length guide, diluent and mixing supplies (based on vaccine product) and much more. \n",
      "\n",
      "The PMCCâ„¢Â ensures that all Covid-19 vaccination providers, participating in the U.S. Covid-19 Vaccination Program are able to: \n",
      "\n",
      "Maintain cold chain conditions and chain of custody at all times, with one or more locking mechanisms, in accordance with the EUA/vaccine packet insert and CDC guidelines \n",
      "Monitor the MicroCoolÂ® Refrigerator temperature at all times using a DDL of their choosing \n",
      "Ensure proper vaccine and supply inventory prior to the start of each vaccination clinic day \n",
      "Have immediate access to all required Covid-19 Ancillary Supplies \n",
      "Per the CDC, every year vaccine storage and handling errors result in revaccination and significant financial losses to the healthcare community due to wasted vaccines. Failure to store and handle vaccines properly causes our population to lose confidence in vaccines and their providers (due to a revaccination) because the vaccines they received may have been compromised. The PMCCâ„¢ allows providers to properly store and handle vaccines with the built-in MicroCoolÂ® Refrigerator. The all-terrain casters allow for use of the PMCCâ„¢ outdoors on asphalt/concrete, grass/turf type surfaces or inside a facility. The PMCCâ„¢ allows for every entity to address their needs while adhering to the CDC's Best Practices for a Vaccination Clinic. Creche Innovations has commenced production in Q4 2020 and plans to launch in the United States and Canada beginning in January 2021.
